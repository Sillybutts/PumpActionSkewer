# PumpActionSkewer
A pump action version of the Charamile Designs Skewer.

- Changelog: 5-12-22: Updated design to V2, with tons of improvements. Wiped previous changelogs, as they are now non-applicable. v1 files are still available in a .zip file.
- Changelog: 5-19-22: Added a replacement Coupler for use with the extendable stock option. It is in the extendable stock folder, file name "Coupler XTND".

My attempt to show how smooth this blaster is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM3zugnxCN0


This is a full overhaul of the Charamile Designs Skewer, turning it into an extremely smooth, very sturdy pump action blaster.

## "Isn't this just a Talon Claw?"

No. This blaster varies greatly from the Talon Claw. It is more similar in feel to an SBL than a TCv3.

Compared to a TCv3, the blaster is shorter in overall length, has a shorter and smoother prime, better ergonomics, a smoother magwell, and a ton of small quality of life improvements.

Also, IMO, the Pump Skewer has much sleeker aesthetics.

I personally believe that this is nicer and smoother than all the other similar blasters currently out there. It might not have all the features of those other blasters, but it is a nicer blaster as a whole. I am, of course, biased ;)

This blaster is compatible with TCV3 rambases, TC ramrods, and TCV3 plungers. This blaster uses the same trigger, sear, and mag release as the Skewer, so any replacements for those parts should work. You can also use x-orings meant for a TC in this blaster. 

This blaster works with any TC length barrels. 

This blaster uses TC length springs, such as K25, 788, or SF25/Pro25.
